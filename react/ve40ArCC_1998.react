# MARLEY reaction data for charged-current nu_e on 40Ar

#
# B(GT) values for levels below 7.0 MeV are taken from
# M. Bhattacharya, et al., Phys. Rev. C 58, 3677 (1998).
# The B(GT) values were then quenched
# by multiplying by (gV/gA)^2 = (1/1.26)^2
# as described in footnote b of Table I in
# M. Bhattacharya, et al., Phys. Rev. C 80, 055501 (2009).
# The B(F) + B(GT) values given in the 1998 paper were
# 0.90 1.50 0.11 0.06 0.04 0.01 0.16 0.26 0.01
# 0.05 0.11 0.29 3.84 0.31 0.38 0.47 0.36 0.23
# 0.03 0.11 0.13
# The B(F) value for the isobaric analog state (IAS)
# at 4.384 MeV is taken from the same paper.
# 40Sc levels are used for observed strengths that did
# not correspond to 40K levels known in 1998.
#
# B(GT) values for levels above 7.0 MeV are theoretical
# estimates based on a QRPA calculation. They were extracted
# using WebPlotDigitizer (http://arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer/)
# from the plot of QRPA integrated GT(-) strength
# given in figure 3 of M. Cheoun, et al.,
# Eur. Phys. J. A 48, 137 (2012).
# The threshold for using theoretical B(GT) values
# was determined by choosing the first level from
# the QRPA calculation for which (1) the QRPA
# integrated B(GT) strength exceeded the experimental
# integrated B(GT) strength at the highest measured
# experimental level, and (2) the integrated B(GT)
# strength for the entire combined dataset (experimental
# plus theoretical values) agreed well with the
# integrated B(GT) strength from the QRPA calculation.
# QRPA strengths for levels below this cutoff were ignored.
