# Example ROOT macros

This directory contains several example ROOT macros that can be used to plot
truth information from MARLEY events.  To use these macros, you will need to
build MARLEY against an installation of ROOT. This will be handled by the
standard Makefile (${MARLEY}/build/Makefile) automatically if the root-config
executable is visible on the system PATH.

Once MARLEY has been linked to ROOT successfully, running the mroot script
(located in ${MARLEY}/build/ following a successful build) will start the ROOT
interpreter and load class dictionaries needed to interpret marley::Event
objects written to a ROOT TTree. All of the macros below are designed to be
run from within an mroot session.

Brief descriptions of each of the example macros, together with the syntax
needed to run them within the mroot interpreter, are given below.

ecos_plot.C
-----------

Plot a histogram of cos(theta) values for the outgoing electron, where
cos(theta) is the angle between the electron and the incident neutrino.

Usage:

  .x ecos_plot.C("/path/to/event/file.root")

Ex.C
----

Plot a histogram of excitation energies accessed by the initial two-two
scatter on the argon nucleus.

Usage:

  .x Ex.C("/path/to/event/file.root")

fp_spect.C
----------

Plot a histogram of kinetic energies for the final particle type with
a given Particle Data Group (PDG) code.

Usage:

  .x fp_spect.C("/path/to/event/file.root", PDG code)


nu_spect.C
----------

Plot a histogram of the reacting neutrino energies sampled by the generator.

Usage:

  .x nu_spect.C("/path/to/event/file.root")

print_events.C
--------------

Print a human-readable description of each event in the ROOT file.

Usage:

  .x print_events.C("/path/to/event/file.root")

reco_spectrum.C
---------------

Plot the true spectrum of reacting neutrino energies, the reconstructed
spectrum if we miss every neutron but see everything else perfectly, and the
reconstructed spectrum if we see only the electron (and add in the
ground-state-to-ground-state Q value).

Usage:

  .x reco_spectrum.C("/path/to/event/file.root")
