This directory contains several example ROOT macros that can be used to
analyze MARLEY events at the 4-vector level. Brief descriptions of each
of these macros are given below. To use these macros, you will need
to build the MARLEY shared library for ROOT support (libMARLEY_ROOT.so on
Linux systems) and load it into the ROOT interpreter. To load the
libMARLEY_ROOT library, open ROOT and execute the setup_marley.C
macro (provided in this directory) like this:

  .x setup_marley.C

If ROOT cannot find the library, then you'll need to add the directory that
contains libMARLEY_ROOT.so to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable (or
equivalent on non-Linux systems) and try again.

ROOT 6 note: starting with version 6 of ROOT, the precompiled dictionary
dynamic libraries do not contain some of the information present in the
headers. This will prevent the macros described below from working correctly
unless the headers are made visible to ROOT. The MARLEY headers should be
installed in a directory of the form /path/to/include/marley. To make ROOT 6
aware of their existence, execute

  gInterpreter->AddIncludePath("/path/to/include")

where /path/to/include is the parent of a directory called "marley" that
contains the MARLEY headers Particle.hh and Event.hh. After you execute
this command, the setup_marley.C macro should work normally.

ecos_plot.C
-----------

Plot a histogram of cos(theta) values for the outgoing electron, where
cos(theta) is the angle between the electron and the incident neutrino.

Usage:

  .x ecos_plot.C("/path/to/event/file.root")

Ex.C
----

Plot a histogram of excitation energies accessed by the initial two-two
scatter on the argon nucleus.

Usage:

  .x Ex.C("/path/to/event/file.root")

fp_spect.C
----------

Plot a histogram of kinetic energies for the final particle type with
a given Particle Data Group (PDG) code.

Usage:

  .x fp_spect.C("/path/to/event/file.root", PDG code)


nu_spect.C
----------

Plot a histogram of the reacting neutrino energies sampled by the generator.

Usage:

  .x nu_spect.C("/path/to/event/file.root")

print_events.C
--------------

Print a human-readable description of each event in the ROOT file.

Usage:

  .x print_events.C("/path/to/event/file.root")

reco_spectrum.C
---------------

Plot the true spectrum of reacting neutrino energies, the reconstructed
spectrum if we miss every neutron but see everything else perfectly, and the
reconstructed spectrum if we see only the electron (and add in the
ground-state-to-ground-state Q value).

Usage:

  .x reco_spectrum.C("/path/to/event/file.root")
