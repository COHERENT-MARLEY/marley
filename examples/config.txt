# Comments may be added anywhere by creating a line with '#' as the
# first non-whitespace character. All other lines should begin with
# a command keyword (all currently allowed keywords are used in this example)
# followed by any required arguments. Arguments are whitespace-delimited.
# An argument list may be continued on multiple lines by using a single '&' as
# the last argument on each line to be continued.

# NUCLEAR STRUCTURE DATA
# Load discrete level data and gamma-ray branching ratios for the specified
# nuclides. To get the recommended data, please visit http://marleygen.org
# and click on the "structure data" link on the main page. You will need
# to add the full path to the second entry (e.g., z019) on each line if you
# run MARLEY from a directory other than the one used to store the structure
# data.

# REACTION DATA
# Use B(F) and B(GT) matrix elements from the analog 40Ti beta decay
# (Bhattacharya, et al., 1998) to compute 40Ar(ve, e-)40K reaction cross

# ALTERNATE DATASET (comment the previous "reaction" line by adding a '#'
# at the beginning, then uncomment the "reaction" line below to use)

# Use B(F) and B(GT) matrix elements from a (p,n) scattering experiment

# SOURCE SPECIFICATION
# Fermi-Dirac distribution with temperature 3.5 MeV (toy SN cooling model)
# The format is "source ve fd Emin Emax T eta" where eta is a pinching
# parameter.
source ve fd   0.   60.   3.5   0.
#
# ALTERNATE SOURCES (keep only one "source" line uncommented)
#
# ***Note: all source spectra used as input to MARLEY should be
# based on the *incident* neutrino flux (i.e., no cross section
# weighting should be applied). MARLEY weights the source spectrum
# defined here using its own cross section model.
#
# Histogram for a uniform ve energy distribution from 0 MeV to muon mass / 2
# (MeV) Within a histogram bin, energies are sampled uniformly on the half-open
# interval [Ebin_left, Ebin_right).
# The format is "source ve hist bin1_left weight1 [bin2_left weight2] ... Emax"
#source ve hist 0 1 52.82918575
#
# "Beta fit" spectrum (see, e.g., http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00806)
# The format is "source ve bf Emin Emax Emean beta"
#source ve bf 0. 60. 15. 4.5

# Muon decay-at-rest ve spectrum

#
# Tabulated (energy, probability density) ordered pairs
# Interpolation methods include "lin" (linear-linear), "log" (log-log),
# "linlog" (linear in E, logarithmic in PD) and "loglin" (log in E, linear in
# PD). The probability density function will be automatically normalized by
# MARLEY.
# The format is "source ve grid method E_1 PD_1 E_2 PD_2 [E_3 PD_3] ..."
#source ve grid lin 0. 0.  25. 2.  50. 0.

# RANDOM NUMBER SEED
# Use the system time since the Unix epoch to seed the MARLEY random number
