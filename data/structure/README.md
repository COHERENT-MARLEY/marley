Recommended nuclear structure data for MARLEY
=============================================

Revised 23 April 2020 by S. Gardiner

Introduction
------------

This directory contains the nuclear structure data recommended for use with the
MARLEY event generator. The data for potassium-40 are based on the 2017 ENSDF
evaluation for A=40 (see https://bit.ly/2Y4nPdg for details). Data for all
other nuclides included in this collection are taken from files that were
originally produced by A. Koning, S. Hilaire, and M. Duijvestijn for use with
the nuclear code TALYS-1.6. The original versions (in a different format)
appear in the TALYS tar.gz file under the directory
talys/structure/levels/exp/. For information about
TALYS, please see http://talys.eu.
