.. Redirect to a local path trick taken from
   https://stackoverflow.com/a/37755644/4081973

   This gets around Sphinx's inability to handle relative links
   in the toctree (see https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/701).
   This comes at the price of a manual redirect.

   An alternative you can consider is putting raw HTML in the toctree
   itself, see, e.g., https://stackoverflow.com/a/61506452/4081973

.. <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=./_static/doxygen/index.html" />
