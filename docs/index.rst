The material presented here focuses on the practical aspects of MARLEY:
installing the code, configuring and running simulations, and analyzing the
output events. For more details on the MARLEY physics models, please see the
references in the online `bibliography <pubs.html>`__.

MARLEY follows an open-source development model and welcomes contributions of
new input files and code improvements from the community. A partial list of
potential projects for future MARLEY development is available on the developer
documentation `webpage <dev_docs.html#development-wish-list>`__.
