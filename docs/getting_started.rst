Obtaining the code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The source code for MARLEY may be downloaded as a compressed archive file (in
either ``zip`` or ``tar.gz`` format) from the GitHub `releases webpage
<https://github.com/MARLEY-MC/marley/releases>`__. Both the current release and
all official past releases are available for download.

After downloading the source code, the user should unpack the archive file
in the desired installation folder. For the v1.2.0 release in ``tar.gz``
format, this may be done via the command

::

  tar xvfz marley-1.2.0.tar.gz

After unpacking the source code, the user should navigate to the root of the
source code tree before following the build instructions below. For the current
example, this may be done via the command
::

  cd marley-1.2.0

Users interested in contributing to MARLEY development should follow the
instructions given `here <dev_docs.html#code-checkout>`__ instead of
downloading and unpacking a release archive file.
