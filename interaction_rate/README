The interactions rates are calculated for a supernova at 10 kpc distance.  
The user can choose between normal and inverted mass hierarchy.  
The most up-to-date (as of 5/7/2015) oscillation parameters are used on 
the supernova flux spectrum before folding with the cross-section data.
The resulting spectrum, interaction rate as a function of energy, is 
normalized to unity and can be used to randomly generate a realistic-looking 
interaction distribution.

The number of events in a given detector can be obtained from:
Rate = (nu Flux at Earth's surface) x (cross-section) x (number of Argon atoms)
