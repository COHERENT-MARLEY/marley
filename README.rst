Introduction
------------

.. overview-start

**MARLEY** (Model of Argon Reaction Low Energy Yields) is a Monte Carlo event
generator for tens-of-MeV neutrino-nucleus interactions. The current version
primarily focuses on simulations of the charged-current reaction

|ve40ArCC|

Preparation of new reaction input files will allow MARLEY to simulate
additional reactions on more target nuclei. Users interested in extending the
functionality of MARLEY in this way are encouraged to contact the author.

Citing MARLEY
-------------

.. citing-start

If you refer to MARLEY in academic work, please **always cite** the following
reference:

S. Gardiner, `Nuclear Effects in Neutrino
Detection <http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3903986>`__, PhD thesis,
University of California, Davis (2018).

Providing a citation for the MARLEY code itself is also encouraged and
appreciated. To maximize reproducibility of published calculations, such
citations should include the digital object identifier (DOI) associated with
the code release that was used. The DOIs for recent versions of MARLEY are
listed on the GitHub `releases webpage
<https://github.com/MARLEY-MC/marley/releases>`__ and in the right-hand column
of the Zenodo "concept DOI" `webpage
<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3901933>`__.

For convenience, recommended `BibTeX <http://www.bibtex.org/>`__ citations to
use for the latest MARLEY release are given in the `CITATION.bib
<CITATION.bib>`__ file.

If you use the default nuclear structure data files (strongly recommended) for
published calculations, please also give proper attribution to the developers
of the TALYS nuclear code (see `data/structure/README.md
<data/structure/README.md>`__ for more information).

Getting Started
---------------

MARLEY is regularly `tested <https://travis-ci.org/github/MARLEY-MC/marley>`__
on both Linux and macOS platforms and is expected to work in any Unix-like
environment in which the prerequisites are installed. Building and running
MARLEY on Windows is not currently supported.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three prerequisites needed to build MARLEY:

.. class:: open

*  A C++14-compliant compiler. The following compilers are officially
   supported:

   -  `GNU Compiler Collection <https://gcc.gnu.org>`__ (GCC) >= 4.9.4

   -  `Clang <https://clang.llvm.org>`__ >= 3.5.2

*  `GNU Make <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/>`__

*  `GNU Scientific Library <https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>`__ (GSL)

   - MARLEY's `Makefile <build/Makefile>`__ verifies that GSL is installed by
     checking that the ``gsl-config`` executable is available on the system
     ``PATH``.

On Linux machines, all three of these prerequisites will likely be available
through the standard package manager. On macOS, installing GSL may be done
using `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`__.

Building MARLEY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the code, enter the ``build/`` folder

::

    cd build

and then run GNU make

::

    make

If the build is successful, then executing

::

    ./marley

should produce the following output:

::

    Usage: marley [OPTION...] CONFIG_FILE

      -h, --help     Print this help message
      -v, --version  Print version and exit

    MARLEY home page: <http://www.marleygen.org>
    E-mail bug reports to: <support@marleygen.org>

Configuring the runtime environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``marley`` executable relies on the system environment variable ``MARLEY``
to store the full path to the root folder of the source code. This variable may
be set automatically by executing ("sourcing") the ``setup_marley.sh`` Bash
script using the ``source`` command. From within the ``build/`` folder, for
example, one may source the setup script via

::

    source ../setup_marley.sh

If generation of events is attempted without setting the ``MARLEY`` environment
variable first, then MARLEY will halt after printing the error message

::

    [ERROR]: The MARLEY environment variable is not set. Please set it (e.g.,
    by sourcing the setup_marley.sh script) and try again.

For user convenience, the ``setup_marley.sh`` script also adds the ``build/``
folder to the system ``PATH`` and to either ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` (Linux) or
``DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`` (macOS).

Generating events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``marley`` command-line executable allows the user to adjust simulation
parameters via JSON-like configuration files. To generate events using an
example configuration file, execute the following command from within the
``build/`` folder after sourcing the ``setup_marley.sh`` script:

::

    marley ../examples/config/annotated.js

The program will display the MARLEY logo and diagnostic messages as it runs the
simulation. When the program terminates, two new files will be present in the
``build/`` folder:

.. class:: open

* ``events.ascii`` contains the generated events in MARLEY's native
  ASCII format

* ``marley.log`` contains logging messages from the simulation

The example configuration file (``examples/config.js``) is heavily commented,
and reading it serves as a good next step for new users. When you are ready to
start writing your own configuration files, editing a copy of
``examples/COPY_ME.js`` is recommended.
