MARLEY (Model of Argon Reaction Low Energy Yields)
==================================================

Introduction
------------

MARLEY (Model of Argon Reaction Low Energy Yields) is a Monte Carlo event
generator for tens-of-MeV neutrino-nucleus interactions in liquid argon. The
current version includes matrix element evaluations for the charged-current
reaction
&nu;<sub>e</sub> + <sup>40</sup>Ar &rarr; e<sup>&mdash;</sup> + <sup>40
</sup>K<sup>*</sup> only. With some additional matrix element
evaluations, MARLEY could be expanded to include more reactions and more target
nuclei. Users interested in creating reaction matrix element evaluations for
new reactions or new nuclear targets are encouraged to contact the MARLEY
development team (<support@marleygen.org>).
