              MARLEY (Model of Argon Reaction Low Energy Yields)

Introduction
------------

MARLEY (Model of Argon Reaction Low Energy Yields) is a Monte Carlo event
generator for tens-of-MeV neutrino-nucleus interactions in liquid argon. The
current version only includes matrix element evaluations for the
charged-current reaction ve + 40Ar --> e- + 40K*. With some additional matrix
element evaluations, MARLEY could be expanded to include more reactions and
more target nuclei. Users interested in creating reaction matrix element
evaluations for new reactions or new nuclear targets are encouraged to contact
the MARLEY development team (support@marleygen.org).
