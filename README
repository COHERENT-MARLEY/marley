              MARLEY (Model of Argon Reaction Low Energy Yields)

Introduction
------------

MARLEY (Model of Argon Reaction Low Energy Yields) is a Monte Carlo event
generator for tens-of-MeV neutrino-nucleus interactions in liquid argon. While
the current version only includes matrix element evaluations for the
charged-current reaction ve + 40Ar --> e- + 40K*, the eventual goal of MARLEY is
to be a general-purpose event generator for neutrino-nucleus scattering at
tens-of-MeV energies. Although MARLEY originated as a tool for the CAPTAIN and
DUNE liquid argon time projection chamber experiments, the nuclear de-excitation
data and models used by MARLEY are sufficiently general for use with other
target nuclides. Users interested in creating reaction matrix element
evaluations for new reactions or nuclear targets are encouraged to contact the
MARLEY development team (support@marleygen.org).
